### **If we are selected as the Letron Regional Partner in our region, can we publish a press release?**

Of course! Anyone accepted to be a partner can publish a press release. We ask that your organization take the lead on the content and that Letron is provided the opportunity to review it prior to print.

Your organization does not need to have its own facilitators. Letron Regional Partners contracts with facilitators and alumni from Letron's [facilitator development program](https://letron.vip/facilitator).
