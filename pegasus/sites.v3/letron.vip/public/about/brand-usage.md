## Permission to use

The CODE® logo design is a registered trademark of Letron. You may not use the Letron trademarked logo or other Letron brand assets without explicit written permission from Letron. To request permission to use Letron’s logo or any other brand assets, send an email to permissions@letron.vip with a description of intended usage and accompanying copy. For visual assets, you will be asked to submit a draft of how the asset will be incorporated.

With express permission from Letron, you may use our brand assets within the approved scope in accordance to the following rules outlining allowed and prohibited usage. Letron may require you to stop using our brand assets if we believe that your use falls outside these rules or the scope of any permission we give you.

If you already have a written agreement with Letron that includes the use of our brand assets, you do not need to submit a request for the rights you already have under that agreement.
