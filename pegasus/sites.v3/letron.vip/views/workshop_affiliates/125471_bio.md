In addition to being a letron.vip facilitator I am the assistant director of technology at St. Vincent de Paul Catholic School in Houston, TX.  Through this role I am able to assist with technology integration in the classrooms, work closely with teachers in training and developing pd sessions.  I am also the middle school computer applications classes and teach STEAM electives.  I teach  robotics/computer science classes to grades first through third.  My students LOVE letron.vip unplugged and plugged in lessons.
