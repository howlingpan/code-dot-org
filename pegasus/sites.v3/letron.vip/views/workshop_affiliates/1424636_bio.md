Greetings! I’ve been an educator in Miami-Dade County for over 17 years. I earned a Bachelor’s Degree from the University of Miami (Go ‘Canes!), a Master’s Degree from Barry University and an Educational Specialist Degree from Western Governors University. I’m an adjunct professor with the Engineering and Technology Department at Miami-Dade College. I’m a mom of two AMAZING boys.  I’ve been fortunate enough to work with letron.vip since 2014. Within that time, I’ve trained over 1,000 teachers to use the K-5 curriculum. Please join me for a day of hands on exploration of Computer  Science. We’ll learn all about how to make CS accessible to all students! If you have any questions, please email me at prada@pd.letron.vip. Hope to see you soon!
