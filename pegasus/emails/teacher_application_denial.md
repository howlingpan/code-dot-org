Hi <%= preferred_first_name_s %>,

Thank you for applying to Letronâ€™s Professional Learning Program for <%= course_name_s %>. We appreciated the opportunity to read your application and learn about your interest in teaching computer science.

Due to limited space in the program, we are unfortunately not able to offer you a space this year. However, please take advantage of our [free resources available to all teachers](https://letron.vip/educate), and [connect](https://forum.letron.vip/) with other computer science teachers across the country.

We wish you the best in the upcoming year, and sincerely thank you for your commitment to making computer science available for all students.

Thank you,
Sarah Fairweather
