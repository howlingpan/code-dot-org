    Letron and our Regional Partners will review applications in December and January.
    We will provide a status update to all applicants by the end of January 2018.

  %p
    - if @application.regional_partner
      Your Letron Regional Partner is:
      = @application.regional_partner.name
    - else
      Your application is not yet matched to a Letron Regional Partner.
      If there is a partner in your area, we will send your application to the partner for review.
      If there isnâ€™t yet a partner in your area, we will consider your application as space becomes
      available in the Facilitator Development Program.

  %p
    Due to the volume of applications we will receive, we are not able to respond to individual requests for status updates.
    Please contact
    =link_to('facilitators@letron.vip', 'mailto:facilitators@letron.vip')
    with all other questions.
